Refuge Quarto Revealjs
=======================

## Overview

A National Wildlife Refuge System presentation theme for Quarto Reveal.js, inspired by Grant McDermott's clean revealjs template [quarto-revealjs-clean](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean).

## Usage

Depending on your use case, here are some [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/)
commands to get started.

If you would like to add the **clean** theme to an existing directory:

```bash
quarto install extension USFWS/refuge-quarto-revealjs
```

Alternatively, you can use a
[Quarto template](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/starter-templates.html)
that bundles the **clean** theme plus a .qmd starter document. This is a better
option if you are starting a new project from scratch, since it will automatically
create a new directory with all of the necessary scaffolding in one go. 

```bash
quarto use template USFWS/refuge-quarto-revealjs
```
